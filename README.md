  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## Automated testing
### Google Developer Tools

For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### W3C Validator Tools

I had an error on the index.html page with div class not being closed correctly.

I also had an error on the gallery.html page with container class not being set correctly.

The gallery.html had an error with div class were not closed after adjustments had been made.

## Development Cycle
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

There were many elements I changed, re-positioned and added from my original wireframes as they were more visually appealing.

### Landing page:
  - The orginal wireframe had the hero image with a introduction box inside the hero image.  I chose to place the introduction, under the hero image as the image was so powerful I didn't want it to be corupted.

### Career page:
- My orginal idea was to have a text box on the left, this would go through Senna career and rivals.  On the right I would have images showing the best parts of his career.
- I chose to overall this page and go with a time line approach instead.  This looks at each team he drove for and the highlights of his time with that team.  I also included images of the teams logo.

### Death page:
- This page was removed entirly as at the time I didn't think it was appropiate to add to the website.

### Gallery page:
- The gallery page was added instead of the death page, I felt this would be more approprite to add positive highlights of Sennas career, instead of his final moments.

### Newsletter page:
 - This was initially going to be a Legacy/Newsletter page.  However as discussed previously, since removing the Death page I alos decided to remove the Legacy section as well.
 - The Newsletter was updated with more color to make it more appling.
