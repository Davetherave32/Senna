## Testing
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

## Automated testing
### Google Developer Tools

For every element that I added to my HTML, I would add the basic CSS to my stylesheet. I would then use the inspect element to try different styles. Once I've got it to my liking I would copy the CSS from google into my stylesheet. This allows me to keep track of the code I am using.

### Responsive Tools

I used [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) to make sure that all my pages are responsive to all devices.

### W3C Validator Tools

I used [W3C Markup](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input+with_options) to check for any errors within my HTML pages.

I had an error on the index.html page with div class not being clossed correctly.

I also had an error on the gallery.html page with container class not being set correctly.

The gallery.html had an error with div class were not closed after adjustments had been made.

I used [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check for any error within my CSS stylesheet.

# 5. Development Cycle
  [Go to the top](#table-of-contents)

There were many elements I changed, re-positioned and added from my original wireframes as they were more visually appealing.

### All pages:
 - Replaced the Sir Alex Photo on the top right with just a text. This is visually more appealing because the text can fit inside the navigation bar.

### Landing page:
  - The original wireframe lacked attention from users. I added an embedded YouTube video to make the user more variety with different media elements. This video is also a short introduction to what the website is about.

### Career page:
  - I added a statistics panel to show the numbers Sir Alex achieved during his career.
  - The original design shows the timeline is continuously on the left side of the page. I decided to change this to make the timeline appear on the centre of the page with the content displaying on the left then the right side of the page. This keeps the user engaged as the content isn't just a block of text.

### Testimonials page:
  - The original wireframe shows this page as an awards page with the same timeline design as the career page however, I changed this to a testimonials page. This is to give the user a better experience with a different format from the career page. As I was planning to use the same design the user would have been less engaged as they felt like they were reading the same content in the same format.
  - I added in a cards view, this gives the user smaller amounts of content so it's easy to process. The image on each card also gives the context of who the quote was from.

### Gallery page:
  - The gallery page has remained the same. I added a hover animation over each photo to give the context of what the image is about.

### Contact page:
 - After coding the contact page to the original design. I thought that it looked dull, so I added other elements to make this page visually appealing to the users.
 - Added google maps location
 - Added icons for location, telephone number and contact email.
