        <h2>Career</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The son of a wealthy businessman and factory owner, Senna discovered his love of racing at the age of 4 when his father introduced him to the world of go-karting. At the age of 10, he received his first full-size go-kart and began racing as soon as he was legally allowed, at age 13. Senna won the South American Kart Championship in 1977 and 1978.
        </p> 
        <p>1981 Senna moved to England to race at the Formula Ford 1600 level for the Van Diemen team. He won several races but left briefly at the end of the season to join the family business. However, he returned to England a short time later to drive Formula Ford 2000 there the next season. In 1983 he moved to Formula Three racing, the second tier of professional Grand Prix racing. Driving for the West Surrey Racing Team, he won the national championship and the Macau Grand Prix. In 1984 he began driving Formula One (F1) for Toleman. In his first year he placed second at the Monaco Grand Prix (although he had taken the lead after 31 laps, the race had been stopped because of bad weather, and a scoring technicality placed him in second).</p>
        <p>Looking for a better car, Senna moved to Lotus in 1985. That year he won the Portuguese Grand Prix and the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium and finished fourth in the season. In 1988 he joined McLaren. In his first season with his new team, Senna won a then record eight races and captured his first Formula One championship. He finished second to teammate Alain Prost in 1989, and tensions between the two led Prost to join Ferrari after the season, establishing a notable rivalry between the two drivers for the next four years. Senna won six and seven races, respectively, in 1990 and 1991, capturing F1 titles in each season. He placed fourth in 1992 and finished second to Prost in 1993, but he ended that season on a high note, winning the final race of the year. It would prove to be the last race victory of his life.</p>

    <h2>Death</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Senna would lose his life at the 1994 Imola Grand Prix.  This was a dark day for motorsports for a number of reasons.</p> <p>On the the Friday practice, fellow Brazilian driver Rubens Barrichello, lost control of his Jordan and crashed into a wall launchin his car into the air.  The Crash looked terrifing, however Barrichello walked away with only a few cuts and brusing.  Friday practice was abbandoned.</p>
    <p>The Saturday qualifying, would see new driver Roland Ratzenberger, failed to negotiate the Villeneuve curva in his Simtek; he subsequently hit the opposing concrete retaining barrier wall almost head-on and was critically injured.  His cause of Death was basal skull fracture.  Saturday qualifying was abbandoned and Simtek with drew from the Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Sunday was race day and Ayrton had pole position.  Prof Sid Watkins, the F1 doctor who treated Rubens Barrichello injuries and pronunced Roland Ratzenberger dead, recalled in his memories "I tried to persuade Senna not to race the following day, asking "What else do you need to do? You have been world champion three times, you are obviously the quickest driver. Give it up and let's go fishing." Senna replied, "Sid, there are certain things over which we have no control. I cannot quit, I have to go on."
    On lap 7, Senna exited Tamburello (a left hand corner), however the car disdn't change direction and continued straight and hit a concrete wall at 211 km/h (131 mph).  Senna was killed instantly.  Inside the cockpit of Senna's car was an Austrian flag, he planned to raise it in honour of Roland Ratzenberger.</p>
    
    <p>Senna was given a state funeral in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil on 5 May 1994. Approximately 500,000 people lined the streets to watch the coffin pass. Senna's arch-rival Alain Prost was among the pallbearers. The majority of the Formula One community attended Senna's funeral; however the president of the sport's governing body, the FIA, Max Mosley attended the funeral of Ratzenberger instead which took place on 7 May 1994 in Salzburg, Austria. Drivers Gerhard Berger and Johnny Herbert were present as well. Mosley said in a press conference ten years later, "I went to (Ratzenberger's) funeral because everyone went to Senna's. I thought it was important that somebody went to his."</p>

    <h2>Legacy</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Since Senna death, many changes have been made to F1 regarding driver safety.These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered for 1995. </p> 
    
    <p>A few months before his death, Senna had discussed with his sister the foundation of a charitable organization, based on a desire to contribute to those less fortunate in a more organised and effective manner. After his death, Viviane Senna set up the Instituto Ayrton Senna in his honour, which has invested nearly US$80 million over the last 12 years in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, NGOs, and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals.[193] The foundation is officially advised by Bernie Ecclestone, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger.</p>
